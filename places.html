          <p>
            The world looks different when viewed from a mountain plateau at
            2,500 metres above sea level: the landscape appears almost
            upside-down. Since ancient times, this land has been known as a

          <h3>Bahir Dar and lake Tana</h3>
          <p>
            Bahir Dar, "the gate to the sea", is a pleasant city on the bank of
            lake Tana, where, according to the local tradition, the source of

            In the province of Lasta, the ancient village of Roha took the name

            The legend of Aksum began around the time of King Solomon (950
            B.C.). It tells of a young woman named Makeda who destroyed the

            Simien in Amharic means “north” and indeed this mountainous massif
            is located in the north of the Ethiopian plateau. It reaches a peak
            of 4,460 metres above sea level with the Ras

            Located to the east of the country on a branch of the Ethiopian

          <p>
            The Ethiopian mountain plateau slopes towards the south, crossed by
            the enormous Rift Valley. The Rift Valley is essentially a huge
            crack in the earth, extending from the Middle East to Mozambique.

            To the west, the mountain plateau slopes towards the Sudan. Here are
